# DiscordTextFormat
Add Discord-styled text formatting to your Bukkit server chat

The plugin currently supports these styles:
- `**` (bold)
- `__` (underline)
- `*` or `_` (italic)
- `~~` (strike through)
- `'` - that key with `~` (magic/obfuscated)

To send a formatted message, just wrap your text with one of the formatting styles available. For example:

`**this should be bold**`
changes to
__`this should be bold`__
